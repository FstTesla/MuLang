# 19. Portable intermediate representation

The compiler MUST lower validated source into a runtime-independent typed intermediate representation before export.

The portable IR compilation unit SHOULD contain:

- compilation mode metadata;
- the language-profile fingerprint;
- the environment fingerprint;
- a distinguished top-level entry function;
- zero or more user-defined functions;
- independent parameter, local, and temporary slot spaces for each function;

- constants;
- local slots;
- basic blocks;
- typed load and store instructions;
- global reads;
- property and array operations;
- intrinsic array-length reads;
- property removal;
- provider calls by stable symbolic identifier;
- user-defined calls by compiler-assigned stable identifier;
- explicit conversions;
- explicit null tests and branches for null-coalescing evaluation;
- truthiness normalization from one non-void source slot to one `bool` destination slot;
- branches and jumps;
- returns;
- source-span associations.

The IR MUST encode evaluation order and short-circuit behavior explicitly.

The IR validator MUST require a truthiness-normalization destination to have type `bool`, its source to have a non-void type, both slots to exist, and the source to be definitely defined.

Runtime exporters MUST NOT perform name resolution, type inference, overload resolution, or high-level control-flow interpretation.

The first language version does not require the IR to be public or serializable.
